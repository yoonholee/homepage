I'm a second-year CS Ph.D. student at Stanford, advised by [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) and part of the [IRIS lab](https://irislab.stanford.edu/).
I am affiliated with [SAIL](https://ai.stanford.edu/), [CRFM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/), and the [ML Group](http://ml.stanford.edu/).
My research is supported by [KFAS](https://eng.kfas.or.kr/theme/kfaschanel/intl_scholarship_5.php).

Previously, as alternative military service for the South Korean army, I worked as a research scientist at [Kakao](https://www.kakaocorp.com/) and [AITRICS](https://www.aitrics.com/), working with [Juho Lee](https://juho-lee.github.io/).
Before that, I completed my master's (CS, advised by [Seungjin Choi](http://mlg.postech.ac.kr/~seungjin)) and undergraduate (math) degrees at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/).

Real-world conditions are **nonstationary** rather than static.
My research interest is in building **reliable machine learning systems** that can navigate and make sound decisions in such perpetually changing environments.
Here are some key questions that guide my research:

- **Adaptation**: How can we build systems that can quickly and robustly adapt in changing conditions?
- **Understanding fine-tuning**: How can we better conceptualize fine-tuning as applied in practice? What knowledge is present in foundation models, and what factors influence how much knowledge is preserved during fine-tuning?
- **Underspecification**: No dataset fully specifies its intended task. How can we make models recognize and represent the multitude of possible realities consistent with given data?
- **De-risking errors**: What strategies can we employ to handle the reality of machine learning systems generating potentially erroneous outputs?
- **Usable information**: How can we formalize and quantify the amount of information in a dataset that is (1) learnable by a neural network and/or is (2) pertinent to a given task?
- **Better teaching**: Is there a more efficient or robust way to teach machines, beyond passive observation or imitation, so that they more easily "understand" the underlying concepts?
